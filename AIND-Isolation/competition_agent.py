    Parameters
    ----------
    data : string
        The name of the search method to use in get_move().

    timeout : float (optional)
        Time remaining (in milliseconds) when search is aborted.  Note that
        the PvP competition uses more accurate timers that are not cross-
        platform compatible, so a limit of 1ms (vs 10ms for the other classes)

        time_left : callable
